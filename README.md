Etree or Enhance Tree is a simple project to improve the old and boring tree, colors, icons and a configuration file are just small details that I hope to add to improve the application.

When I upload different versions for different architectures I will update this but for now it was tested on:

- Cross-platform:
  - works on Linux/UNIX, Android
    - Linux x86-64 and arm64.
    - Android arm64.
